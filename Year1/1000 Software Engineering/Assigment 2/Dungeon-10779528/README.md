### The CMDCrawler game is a simple 2D dungeon explorer type game that is simple to play.
 
## Before the user can play they must enter the map they would like to play, there are two options:
 
*"Load simple.map"
 
*"Load simple2.map"
 
*After entering the desired map the user must enter "Start"
 
 
## The controls for this game are:
 
*W to move one tile North
 
*D to move one tile East
 
*S to move one tile South
 
*A to move one tile West
 
*Z to pick up a Coin(C), this can only be done if the player is stood on a C tile 


## The rules for this game are:
 
*The player must reach the finish tile wich is marked as "D"
 
*The player must avoid Monsters (M) as they do not let you move past
 
*The player can pick up coins(C) with Z, but this is not required to finish the game
 
*Walls are '#', players can not go past the walls
